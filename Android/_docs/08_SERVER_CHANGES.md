# ECHO Android: server changes the app must handle

The server changed after the plans in this folder were written. Read this page before
working on the app's networking or login code. Each entry says what the server does now,
what the app should do, and where the details are.

## Auth replies (#33, PR #77, live on Render since 2026-11-11)

Every request now checks the account itself, not only the token. A token stops working
when its account is banned, deactivated or deleted after login.

| Reply | When | What the app should do |
|---|---|---|
| `403` `ACCOUNT_BANNED` | The account was banned | Log out and show "account banned". Logging in again also returns `403`. |
| `403` `ACCOUNT_INACTIVE` | The account was deactivated | Log out and show "account not active". |
| `401` `ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND` | The profile was deleted | Log out and clear local data for that account. |
| `401` `TOKEN_REVOKED`, `TOKEN_VERIFICATION_FAILED`, … | Logged out, expired or bad token | Log out, as before. |
| `503` `AUTH_UNAVAILABLE` | The server can't check the token right now (Redis or MongoDB down) | **Don't log out.** Keep the session and retry later with backoff. |

- These replies have the token-error shape `{ "error": "...", "code": "..." }`, not the
  usual `{ "success": false, ... }`. Branch on `code`, not on the message text.
- The app's networking code must not treat every non-`200` reply as "session expired".
  Only `401` and the two `403` codes above mean the session is over.
- A ban made in the database takes up to 30 seconds to apply. Deleting the profile
  applies at once.
- An open WebSocket isn't closed when the account is banned, deleted or logged out
  (#76). Until that is fixed, the app should close its socket itself on logout.
